					<p>I recently completed <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com" target="_blank">Coding Dojo's</a> online bootcamp, studying the Python and MEAN stacks. I did the bootcamp for a challenge--to invigorate my skills and ultimately get a job doing what I love. I am always up for new challenges and my work history is evidence of this. When the question was asked, “Bruce, would you like to...?”, I usually responded, "Yes", before the sentence was completed. It didn't matter if it was working on the loading dock while waiting for my clearance at Raytheon, moving to Denver or England, taking the Integration and Test lead on a project we bid and won while with TMA, or even developing an e-commerce website. Do you have an exciting challenge? I'm up for it!</p>

							<h2>Location: Virginia</h2>
							<p>On a beautiful fall day, I went hiking with my daughter in the George Washington National Forest. Behind me is a cliff and a vista that even impressed this Montana boy: colorful trees, people (looking like ants), roads, and a valley that stretched forever. And the best part of the day? My daughter, the vegan, prepared lunch. My sandwich was a carnivore's delight: meat, cheese, mayo and some sort of leafy green stuff as well.</p>
