				<p>This website is one example of my work. It is a Django application integrated with MongoDB on the backend. When I learned Django, MySQL was used in the course. I considered this when developing my site, but I already had a Mongo database for my authors application. So I integrated my site with Mongo. I was surprised how easy that was.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid" src="{%static 'home/images/pacmanscreen.png'%}"  alt="Pacman">
				<p>I started developing this while going through Coding Dojo's Web Fundamentals course. There was a video walk-through giving insight on the development process using Pacman as an example. I paused the video early on and started developing the app on my own. I wanted to see how my solution compared to the instructors. When I had some good bones in place, I went back and looked at the instructors solution. My solution diverged from his pretty quickly. I think mine is better of course.</p>
				<p>Give it try. Bring up a separate version in an incognito tab to have multiple sessions.</p>

				<p>My wife and I started European Tableware in 2006. It was an interesting ride, but with the changing e-commerce landscape, we shut it down in 2017.</p>
				<p>It was originally developed on osCommerce in a LAMP stack. After multiple iterations, the final version is mainly my own with just a few hooks left from osCommerce.</p>

				<p>Authors is a full MEAN stack application originally developed as an excercise while I was in Coding Dojo's online bootcamp.</p>
				<p>Deploying the app to brucelecaptain.com was a good learning experience. As with Pacman, I have an nginx server doing a proxy pass to a node server. It worked beautifully in development, but when deployed the node routing fell apart. Figuring out the problems gave me a greater understanding of node routing of an Angular app, and how to have a single version of software "work" in different environments.</p> 
				<p>Documentation of the API is a work in progress and can be found <a href="https://github.com/brulecap/authors/blob/master/books_api_documentation.txt">here</a>. A sample author class can be found <a href="https://github.com/brulecap/authors/blob/master/src/app/author.ts">here</a>.</p>
				<p>If this was a "real" production API, I would want to control access to the http post, put, and delete methods. This would require https and some form of validation, either requiring a key or a login.</p>
