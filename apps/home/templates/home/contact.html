							<p>Location: North Yorkshire, England. Bruce Arms Stable is in the village of West Tanfield just outside Yorkshire Dales National Park. Unfortunately it is not mine. We drove past here a number of times on our trips around the North Yorkshire countryside. And, yep, one day I had to stop and get a picture. The picture was taken in 2000. One of the stuffed animal puppets my daughters, wearing pink and purple, are holding is still alive and well loved.</p>
